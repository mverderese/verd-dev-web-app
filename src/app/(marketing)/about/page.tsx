                After discovering my passion for programming in high school, I pursued a Computer&nbsp;Science degree at
                Rutgers&nbsp;University. I focused on courses that enhanced my product development skills, such as
                Software&nbsp;Methodology, Internet&nbsp;Technology, and Databases, along with the core CS curriculum.

              Right after graduating, I teamed up with three co-founders to create{" "}
              <TextLink link="/portfolio/projects/tag">Tag</TextLink>, a location-based social app for meetups. We
              rented an apartment in New York, developed an MVP, and secured funding from investors like Tim Draper,
              Eduardo Saverin, and Mark Cuban. We expanded our team, launched a campus ambassador program, and quickly
              grew to tens of thousands of users. Eventually, we were acquired by Mark Cuban Companies.

              Over the past decade, Iâ€™ve worked with companies of all sizes, from pre-seed startups to
              multi-billion-dollar corporations. Notably, I worked with a team of four engineers to rebuild the entire{" "}
              <TextLink link="/portfolio/projects/starbucks">Starbucks&nbsp;Ecommerce&nbsp;Store</TextLink> in three
              months, generating over $100 million in holiday revenue. Following that, I joined the founding team of{" "}
              <TextLink link="/portfolio/projects/renew">Renew</TextLink>, where I built the API and DevOps process for
              the Medicare Plan Finder and Customer Success platforms, while mentoring and leading other engineers.

              In 2020, I co-founded <TextLink link="/portfolio/projects/odin">Odin</TextLink>, a workforce management
              and visibility platform for construction, bootstrapping the company to $1 million in revenue in the first
              year. I led the development of a software platform that integrates with external vendors and physical
              hardware, such as turnstiles and cameras, while delivering a user-friendly experience on both web and
              mobile apps. Today, Odin manages over 20,000 workers across 700 contractors nationwide, while growing 12%
              per quarter.

            While I am proud of my professional accomplishments, my greatest joy comes from my incredible wife,
            Michelle, and our precious Goldendoodle, Zoey. When we&apos;re not exploring coffee shops and vegan
            restaurants in Philadelphia, I enjoy traveling, hiking, skiing, drumming, spending time with family, and
            playing Magic:&nbsp;The&nbsp;Gathering. My love for Magic led me to volunteer for a passion project called{" "}

            based on my experiences so far, I&apos;m confident that the next chapter in both my personal and
            professional life will be exciting!
